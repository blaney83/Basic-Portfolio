                My name is Ben Laney. I am currently a student in the University of
                Arizona Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. I have a very diverse background.
                I studied Chemical Engineering for a few years, but never became fully
                engaged in the subject matter. I worked in chemical diagnostics for a
                time in a hospital where my primary focus was specimen processing, analytical
                data processing and data entry. It was during this time that I became
                interested in programming and software as a hobby.
            </p>

            <p>
                After some research and free-lance practice with OS firmware and web
                design, I decided to dive headlong into the field as a full time career.
                I have really enjoyed teaching myself new programs and language
                philosophies during this time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of my professional interests include JavaScript, JQuery, database
                optimization and network configuration. Some of my personal interests
                include music and entertainment (fun fact- I ran high end multi-million
                dollar nightclubs for many years), sports (being a former college
                baseball athlete) and nature (I am an Eagle Scout and I love being
                outside). You can find more of my specific intrests in the lists on this
                page.
